### Animation Philosophy

Every animation serves a purpose:
- **Flying Elements**: Remind us that creativity is always in motion

## üé® Customization Guide

### Changing Colors

The color scheme is controlled by CSS variables in `style.css`:

```css
:root {
    --primary-blue: #4f46e5;
    --primary-purple: #7c3aed;
    --primary-pink: #ec4899;
    /* Add your own colors here */
}
```

### Adding New Sections

1. **Add HTML structure** in `index.html`
2. **Style it** in `style.css` using our design system
3. **Add animations** in `script.js` with GSAP

### Modifying Animations

All animations use GSAP for smooth performance:

```javascript
gsap.to('.your-element', {
    y: -20,
    duration: 0.5,
    ease: "power2.out"
});
```
